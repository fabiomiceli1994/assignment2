To execute the program type "make" into the terminal (" " are not required) and
hit enter. The program is run through a Makefile, provided in .zip folder, so
that no other commands are needed.
For clarity reasons, every test corrrectly performed by the program is printed
on the terminal runtime: the user can thus have a firmer grip on the operations
that are being performed.
The program has been designed in such a way that other possible tests can be
simply executed by means of a simple change of parameters in the main file: a
suitable check of consistency for the given set of parameters has been inserted
as well. The vector alpha, beta and gamma represent the set of
values defining the type of ADR equation one wants to study. In the present case,
the diffusion-advection case has been studied. Changing the values of gamma and
beta, the other can be tested as well.
6 different plotscripts are provided and the final .tex document is generated
automatically through them by the Makefile.
